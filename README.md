# Environmental Sensory Detection Prediction Model

## Overview
The Environmental Sensory Detection Model is designed to monitor and assess the presence of individuals in a room by analyzing various environmental parameters. This sophisticated model utilizes multiple sensors to provide real-time insights into room occupancy and conditions, enhancing security, energy management, and safety monitoring systems.

## Key Features
* Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: Tracks the ambient temperature and moisture levels, identifying human presence through changes in these parameters.
* Gas and Carbon Monoxide Detection: Monitors the levels of harmful gases and carbon monoxide, alerting to potential safety risks or signs of occupancy.
* Motion Detection: Employs motion sensors to detect any physical activity, providing direct evidence of presence.
* Light Sensing: Measures light intensity to detect interactions such as the use of light switches or movement that alters light levels.

## System Requirements
Sensor modules for temperature, humidity, gas, CO, motion, and light.
A central processing unit to analyze sensor data.
Software to interpret sensor input and trigger alerts or actions based on predefined thresholds.
